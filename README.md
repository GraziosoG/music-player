# music-player
This project is built on top of the ["build a music player" tutorial by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTHRWGn_sJw). 
Shout out to **Traversy Media** for this awesome project and the eye-catching design.  I learned a lot from this tutorial and I also have some modifications to the final product. 

Below are the different features that you can see from my version of this product. 
* Change CD cover by clicking on the CD player when music is playing
* Show previous and next track names
* Display track timings
* Enable track selection


Pro-tips:
* Add new tracks to your music player
    1. Navigate into the _music_ directory and put your **mp3** file there. 
    2. Open _music_player.js_ in any text editor and navigate to line 29. 
    3. Add the track name into the _songs_ list with quotes. Example: **'new song name'**
    4. Make sure the _songs_ list have commas in between each track.
    5. Save the _music_player.js_ and you are set to go! 
 
* Add new CD covers to your music player (very similar to the above description)
    1. Navigate into the _images_ directory and put your **jpg** file there. 
    2. Open _music_player.js_ in any text editor and navigate to line 26. 
    3. Add the image name into the _covers_ list with quotes. Example: **'new image name'**
    4. Make sure the _covers_ list have commas in between each image.
    5. Save the _music_player.js_ and you are set to go!
